        <p class="boxed">Hey, I'm Logan Coley and I'm currently enrolled in BCCA.  BCCA is a 11 month fast-paced program where they teach us how to be a full-stack developer and how be professional in a work place enviroment.  I would love to learn rather back-end or game devlopment as a career option spefically, game devlopment has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid.  It would be great when I graduate Basecamp to get a job in creating games so that I can fufill my passion.</p>
